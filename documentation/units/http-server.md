    ;; define a simple service
    ;; this would be part of your application code
    (define-record get-dog-request id)
    (define-record get-dog-response greeting)
    (define (get-dog-service get-dog-request sql-connection authentication configuration)
      (make-get-dog-response "woof"))

    (let ((get-dog-http-binding
            (make-http-binding
              "GET" "^/main/dogs/(\\d{1,6})$" #f "application/json; charset=utf-8"
