    ;; define a simple service
    ;; would be part of your application code
    (define-record get-dog-request id)
    (define-record get-dog-response greeting)
    (define (get-dog-service get-dog-request sql-connection authentication configuration)
      (make-get-dog-response "woof"))

    ;; make an http-binding for the service
    (let ((get-dog-http-binding
            (make-http-binding
              "GET"
              "^/main/dogs/(\\d{1,6})$"

      ;; start serving http requests
      (http-server-start
        (list
