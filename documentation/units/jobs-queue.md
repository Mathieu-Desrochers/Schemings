An endpoint to which clients submit jobs.

__worker-endpoint__  
An endpoint from which workers receive jobs.

with-jobs-queue-connection
--------------------------
Invokes a procedure with a jobs queue connection.

__submit-endpoint__  
An endpoint to which to submit jobs.

__procedure__  
A procedure invoked with the jobs queue connection.

jobs-queue-submit
-----------------
Submits a job to a queue.  
This is a non-blocking call.

__jobs-queue-connection__  
A jobs queue connection.

__u8vector__  
A binary vector representing the job.

jobs-queue-receive
