You love Scheme
---------------
You understand that simplicity is beautiful, and that Scheme
is the very essence of what it means to write software.

But somehow committing to an uncommon language appears risky.
Hard to you guarantee the ecosystem will provide a library for
your needs down the road. Oh dang, there is no YAML parser...

We fought with this dilemma, and this project is our answer to it.

It simple really
----------------
First choose the Scheme implementation you like the most,
Chicken Scheme of course. Then notice it provides an amazing
foreign interface to invoke C libraries. And it clicks.

We will use the Scheme compiler and get the language we want.
We will cherry pick the best C libraries we find, and write
super thin Scheme bindings that make them like family.

The language we love, every library we could ever need.
