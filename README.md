You love Scheme
---------------
You understand that simplicity is beautiful, and that Scheme  
is the very essence of what it means to write software.

But somehow committing to an uncommon language appears risky.  
Hard to guarantee the ecosystem will provide a library for all your  
needs down the road. Oh dang, there is no YAML parser...

We fought with this dilemma, and this project is our answer to it.

It is simple really
-------------------
First you pick the Scheme implementation you like the most,  
Chicken Scheme of course. Then you notice it provides an amazing  
foreign interface to call C libraries. And boom it clicks.

We will use the Chicken compiler and get the language we want.  
And we will write simple interfaces to the best C libraries,  
making them feel all Schemy.

The language we love, every library we could ever need.

Many batteries included
-----------------------
We run a commercial web application based on this project.  
Every library we needed is included here. That covers a broad base.

- base64 encoding
- configuration
- crypto
- emails sending
- fastcgi integration
- http handling
- image processing
- json parsing and formatting
- regular expressions
- sqlite
- unicode

Getting started
---------------
Install the required dependencies.

- [Ubuntu](./documentation/procedures/installing-dependencies-ubuntu.md)
- [FreeBSD](.)

Run the following commands.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Mathieu-Desrochers/Schemings.git Schemings

    $ cd Schemings
    $ make
    $ ./main

    Hello World

Nifty documentation
-------------------
Every unit is fully documented, with minimal stand alone examples.  
You simply copy one inside source/main.scm and do the make dance.

    $ make
    $ ./main

    Result from the chosen example.
